# Algebraic AES
## An implementation of AES-128 using only algebra

This implementation is extremely inefficient, it is intended mainly for showcasing purposes. 

In theory, simply typing `make` should compile the library and the test executable, as long as the 
`CC` and `CFLAGS` environment variable are set or an appropriate compiler is available.
Tested on Windows 11 with MSVC and Ubuntu with GCC 

TODO: fill the README.
